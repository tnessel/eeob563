MULT
    do N random addition sequences, followed by rearrangements. 
    Options are: 
      wagner       no branch-swapping 
      spr          use SPR branch swapping 
      tbr          use TBR branch swapping 
      [no]keepall  keep the trees from all replications 
      replic N     do N replications  
      hold N       save up to N trees per replication (only if swapping) 
      [no]ratchet  do ratchet as well (settings with "ratchet" command) 
      [no]drift    do drift as well (settings with "drift" command) 
      [no]wclus N  after adding N taxa to the wagner tree, start using 
                   node clusters (of size defined with "bbreak:clus SIZE"). 
                   Useful only for very large data sets (several K-taxa). 
      outfreq N    frequency for which reports are produced during branch 
                   swapping (default is every N=10 clips, but for large data 
                   sets this implies reports take too long to be produced). 
      ras          use randomized addition sequences for Wagner trees  
                   [default, works best for most data sets] 
      cas N        use closest-addition sequence for Wagner trees (ties in 
                   the addition sequence broken randomly), looking ahead up 
                   N taxa (no N = all taxa). Tends to work best on data sets 
                   with a lot of incongruence. 
      fas N        as previous one, but using furthest addition sequence 
      ias N        as previous one, but select first those taxa which make 
                   the largest number of characters informative (N.B. only  
                   additive/nonadditive characters considered for this; the 
                   other character types have no influence on the sequence). 
                   Tends to work best on data sets with many missing entries 
                   and non-overlapping blocks of data. 
      sas N        as previous one, but select first those taxa with the  
                   largest difference in score for best/worst locations (N.B. 
                   all character types are considered). Works best for the 
                   same data sets as the previous one ("ias"), but it is 
                   more thorough and slower 
    Usage: "mult:options;" changes settings only; "mult=options;" runs 
    as well.  Entering "mult:;" current settings are reported.  Setting 
    the type of addition sequence also determines the sequence to be used 
    in other commands (e.g. "xmult", "pfijo").  The insertion sequence 
    is always random for "cas", "sas", and "fas"; it can be changed (see 
    under "rseed") to be random or non-random for "ras" and "ias"
