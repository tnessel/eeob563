paup> AllTrees

Error(#531): Exhaustive search is not allowed for more than 12 taxa (unrooted trees). The number of
             trees would exceed the maximum that can be represented as a 32-bit integer value.

paup> BandB

Branch-and-bound search settings:
  Optimality criterion = parsimony
    Character-status summary:
      Of 382 total characters:
        All characters are of type 'unord'
        All characters have equal weight
        198 characters are constant
        61 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative
        Number of parsimony-informative characters = 123
    Gaps are treated as "missing"
  Initial upper bound: unknown (compute heuristically)
  Addition sequence: furthest
  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100
  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
  'MulTrees' option in effect
  No topological constraints in effect
  Trees are unrooted
